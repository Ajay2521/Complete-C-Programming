# Complete-C-Programming

This is a complete C programming tutorial where you can learn all concepts in C programming Language.

Before going directly into the code, have a look at README.md file and follow it .To make this tutorial useful.

## Introduction:

+ C was developed by Dennis Ritchie

### Why C Programmig?

+ Highly portable.
+ Execute faster.
+ General performance.
+ Easy to learn

### What C Programming?

+ Mother Language = Base for other languages.
+ System Programming Language = Used to do Low-level programming.
+ Procedure-Oriented = Series of steps, functions, method.
+ Structured Language = parts or blocks.

### Where C Programming?
+ Operating system.
+ Assemblers.
+ Database.
+ Network.
+ Compiler Design.

## Compiler Installation:

MinGW = [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
